# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TwinGraph! Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of TwinGraph being used
* Your operating system and Python version
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass (`python run_tests.py`).
4. Add tests for any new functionality.
5. Update documentation as needed.
6. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
7. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
8. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional documentation on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/twingraph.git
   cd twingraph
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py --verbose
   ```

4. Check code style:
   ```bash
   black --check twingraph/
   ruff check twingraph/
   ```

## Code Style

- We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python code formatting
- We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting
- All new code should have type hints
- Functions and classes should have docstrings

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for high test coverage
- Include integration tests for cross-component functionality

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add docstrings to all public functions/classes
- Update API documentation in `/docs` if changing APIs
- Include examples for new components
